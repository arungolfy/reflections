When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When there are other contributors to the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    You may end up with stuff that you do not want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Fork somebody else's project from github and the link is maintained.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    Can minimise merge conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    Use svn. Conflict resolution would be harder in svn. For collaboration in a small team maybe svn is enough.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
    Using a separate branch helps in collaborating better and also in resolving merge conflicts better. Using the master directly is perhaps less complicated but can cause errors.
