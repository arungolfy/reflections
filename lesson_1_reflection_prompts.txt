How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me look only on the lines that were changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    The complete history of a file can be used to see my own learning process and to analyse my growth as a programmer.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You only have useful commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    These are focussed towards programmers.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    see man pages

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you are sure of reverting back to a working state

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for my programming exercises and projects.
